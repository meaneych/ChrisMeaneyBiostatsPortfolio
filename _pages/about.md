Hi. My name is Christopher Meaney. 

I work as a Biostatistician at the University of Toronto. In my role, I provide biostatistical consultative services to primary care scientists on diverse clinical research projects. I contribute to formulation of research hypotheses, study planning/design, statistical analysis, data visualization, interpretation, and reporting. 

I am also a doctoral student in Biostatistics at the University of Toronto (Dalla Lana School of Public Health, Division of Biostatistics). My dissertation focuses on matrix factorization techniques for topic modelling, and their application to extracting meaningful insights from primary care electronic medical record text data. 

When I'm not doing biostats things, I like to bike, play golf, DJ and spend time with my two wonderful children.
