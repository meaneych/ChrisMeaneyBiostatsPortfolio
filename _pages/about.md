Hi. My name is Christopher Meaney. 

I work as a Biostatistician at the University of Toronto. In my role, I collaborate with primary care scientists on diverse clinical research projects, guiding study planning/design, statistical analysis, visualization, interpretation, and reporting. 

I am also a doctoral student in Biostatistics at the University of Toronto (DLSPH, Division of Biostatistics). My dissertation focuses on matrix factorization approaches to topic modelling, and their application to extracting meaningful insights from primary care electronic medical record text data. 

When I'm not doing biostats things, I like to bike, play golf, DJ and spend time with my two wonderful children.
