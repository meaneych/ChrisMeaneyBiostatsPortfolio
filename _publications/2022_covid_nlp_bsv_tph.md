The NLP bio-surveillance system was originally developed by Chapman et al in the context of the USVA. The NLP biosurveillance system uses an expert derived dictionary, pattern matching tools and a contextual analyzer to classify documents as 1) COVID-19 positive, 2) COVID-19 negative, or 3) unknown COVID-19 status.
