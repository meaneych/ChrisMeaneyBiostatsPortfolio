This study demonstrates how non-negative matrix factorization can be used to learn a temporal topic model over a large collection of primary care clinical notes, characterizing diverse COVID-19 pandemic effects on the physical/mental/social health of residents of Toronto, Canada. We hypothesize that temporal topic modelling can be applied to large corpora of primary care clinical text data to identify a meaningful topical/thematic summarization which can provide policymakers and public health stakeholders a passive, cost-effective, technology for understanding holistic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the primary healthcare system and community/public-health.
