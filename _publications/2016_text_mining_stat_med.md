This study investigates trends in the utilization of statistical/epidemiological methods over time, using the PubMed OA corpus (1995-2015), consisting of over 1M open access research abstracts. These findings can be useful to biostatisticians/epidemiologists attempting to characterize important methods in their field of research (e.g. for planning educational offerings, etc.).
