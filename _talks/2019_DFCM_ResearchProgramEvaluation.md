This talk illustrates how to mine key performance indicators of research program outputs/impact using computational methods (e.g. Scopus API, PubMed API, web scraping Google scholar). We are currently extending these methods as part of a larger departmental environmental scan. Additional academic knowledge products will be generated from the exercise.
