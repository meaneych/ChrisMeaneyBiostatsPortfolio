Applied natural language processing (in particular statistical semantics) often use large/sparse matrices to represent linguistic utilization patterns in document collections. Statistical decomposition/factorization of these large and sparse data structures can be used to extract meaningful patterns from unstructured clinical text data (in an unsupervised manner). We review how common NLP methods, such as topic modelling and word vector embedding are related to statistical factorizations of input DTM/TCM data structures, respectively.
