This talk illustrates how to mine research program performance indicators using modern computational methods. Scientometric indicators of research program performance include: publication and citation metrics, journal impact factors, altmetric and webometric indicators of social attention, and measures of network/thematic structure. 

The proposed methodology feasibly assesses/evaluates DFCM research program impact, and permits a comparative evaluation of DFCM relative to other leading primary care research institutions. 

Implmenting the proposed methodology at DFCM is feasible, and strengths of the methodology include:
- Computational methodology is transparent, reproducible, and auditable. 
- Passive data collection is cost-effective. 
- APIs generate structured data from reliable data sources.
- Mining raw scientometric data permits downstream bespoke analyses.
