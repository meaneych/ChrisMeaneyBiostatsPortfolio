This talk illustrates how to mine research program performance indicators using modern computational methods.

Scientometric indicators of research program performance include: publication and citation metrics, journal impact factors, altmetric and webometric indicators of social attention, and measures of network/thematic structure.

The proposed computational methodology feasibly characterizes aspects of research program impact at DFCM. Further, the methodology can scalably be used to comparatively evaluate scientometric indicators of DFCM research program performance versus several leading international primary care research institutions.

Implmenting the proposed methodology at DFCM is feasible, and strengths of the methodology include:
- Computational methodology is transparent, reproducible, and auditable. 
- Passive data collection is cost-effective. 
- APIs generate structured data from reliable data sources.
- Mining raw scientometric data permits bespoke downstream analyses.
