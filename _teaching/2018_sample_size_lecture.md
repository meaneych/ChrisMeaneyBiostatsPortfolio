Sample size and power calculation are an important aspect of research study design and planning. This lecture introduces core concepts related to sample size estimation and power analysis, reviews examples/exercises of sample size calculations with analytic solutions, and recommends additional reading/literature for interested students. 

We have given this lecture to graduate students in Community Public Health at the University of Toronto (2013-2021). We have also provided a similar talk to medical residents and fellows at Sick Kids Hospital (Toronto, Canada). Finally, in 2014 we were invited to give a similar talk to medical residents/fellows from the University of Sao Paulo (Brazil).
