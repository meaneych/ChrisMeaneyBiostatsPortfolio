This talk was provided to graduate students enrolled in CHL5222 (Correlated Data Analysis) at the University of Toronto. The lecture was given annually from 2013-2018. The lecture introduces students to R, discusses basic regression functionality in R (e.g. lm and glm); and lastly in highlights the use of advanced regression models (e.g. GEE and GLMM methodologies) for dealing with correlated (non-IID) response data commonly encountered in biostatistics settings.
