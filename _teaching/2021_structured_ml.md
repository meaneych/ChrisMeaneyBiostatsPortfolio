This talk/lecture reviews machine learning methods which are useful for tabular/structured clinical datasets. We review logistic regression and penalized extensions (e.g. logistic lasso). We introduce tree based methods, including CART, random forests and tree-based gradient boosting. This lecture/talk is under review (we need to add examples, a conclusion, etc.). Check back soon for updates.
