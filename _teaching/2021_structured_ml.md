This is a talk/lecture on machine learning methods that are useful for tabular/structured clinical datasets. We review logistic regression and penalized extensions (e.g. lasso). We also introduce tree based methods, including CART, random forests and tree-based gradient boosting. This lecture/talk is under review (as it needs examples, conclusion). Come back soon for updates.
