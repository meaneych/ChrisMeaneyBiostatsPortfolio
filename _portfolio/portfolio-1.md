This portfolio entry showcases the use of primary care clinical text data for passive surveillance of COVID-19 pandemic effects on community physical/mental/social health. We mine a large number of primary care clinical notes from Toronto, Canada between 2017-2021. We learn a latent topical basis over the corpus using non-negative matrix factorizatioon. We convert the latent topical prevalence weights into a multivariate time series, characterizing the evolution of latent topical vectors over our study timeframe. Following initiation of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020), we observe changes to a number of latent topic vectors encoding respiratory conditions, chronic disease prevention and screening, mental health, and social/familial dynamics.
