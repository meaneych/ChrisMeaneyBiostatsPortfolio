We investigate whether a rule-based natural language processing (NLP) system, applied to primary care clinical text data can identify COVID-19 entities, and to classify documents as COVID-19 positive. We seek to construct a COVID-19 NLP-derived time series and assess whether it can be used as a leading indicator of COVID-19 viral activity in Toronto, Canada.
